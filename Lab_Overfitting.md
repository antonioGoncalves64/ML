Overfitting is an undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data but not for new data. When data scientists use machine learning models for making predictions, they first train the model on a known data set. Then, based on this information, the model tries to predict outcomes for new data sets. An overfit model can give inaccurate predictions and cannot perform well for all types of new data.
