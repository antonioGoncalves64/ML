Vectorization is the process of converting an algorithm from operating on a single value at a time to operating on a set of values (vector) at one time. Hence, we can use these techniques to perform operations on Numpy arrays without using loops. It only uses the pre-defined inbuilt functions like the sum function etc.

The concept of vectorized operations on NumPy allows the use of more optimal and pre-compiled functions and mathematical operations on NumPy array objects and data sequences. The Output and Operations will speed up when compared to simple non-vectorized operations.
